# gcontactse164

Had issues with my contacts not being properly formated for international calls. Created this tool/demo to be able to go through all my contacts and correct all of them.

Uses Google Contacts API to read out your phone book and then verify that all phone numbers are in the proper E164 format. That means that they all have + country code in the beginning so it can be dialed from any country.
